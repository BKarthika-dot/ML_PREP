# Explainable AI (XAI)

This folder is dedicated to my study and implementation of **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques as part of my machine learning preparation.

The focus is on understanding **why** a model makes a prediction, not just achieving high accuracy. This is especially important for real-world ML systems used in high-stakes domains such as hiring, healthcare, and finance.

This folder will gradually evolve as I add implementations, experiments, and notes.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an intuitive and practical understanding of XAI methods
- Apply explainability techniques to real ML models
- Analyze model behavior, bias, and decision boundaries
- Connect explainability with fairness and causal reasoning

---

## 🧠 Planned Techniques & Topics

### 1. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
SHAP will be incorporated to analyze feature contributions using concepts from cooperative game theory.

**Planned focus:**
- Local and global feature importance
- Model behavior analysis
- Counterfactual-style explanations
- Applications to tabular ML models

📌 SHAP-based notebooks and scripts will be added here.

---

### 2. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LIME will be used to explain individual predictions by approximating complex models locally with interpretable models.

**Planned focus:**
- Instance-level explanations
- Comparing explanations across samples
- Understanding local decision boundaries

📌 LIME-related experiments will be added here.

---

### 3. Causal Inference & Causal Explainability
This section will explore causal approaches to explainability, moving beyond correlation to **cause–effect relationships**.

**Planned focus:**
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Causal graphs and assumptions
- Interpretable causal explanations for model decisions

📌 Causal inference files and experiments will be added here.
